## Description:
The housing market represents the market for properties being purchased and sold either directly to buyers or through real estate brokers where some of the major 
factors involved in household prices are economic change, supply and demand, mortgage interest rates, location, and government laws. The housing market is subject 
to the same economic laws of supply and demand as every other industry. When there are more buyers than sellers, the supply of houses goes down and the demand goes 
up, making houses harder to buy and more expensive. The typical home value of homes in the United States in 2021 is $298,933. This value is seasonally adjusted and 
only includes the middle price tier of homes. United States home values have gone up 16.7% over the past year and Zillow predicts they will rise 12.1% in the next year.

## Questions:
Our website displays analysis on the previous 10 years of housing market data (2010-2020) and looks into predictions of the next 10 years. We wanted to answer these 
questions:

* How have household prices reacted over the past decade?

* Which states have the highest household prices?

* Which states and cities have the highest growth rate?

* What median home prices could you expect over the next 10 years?

## Analysis:
1. Clean and modify data using Jupyter Notebook/Pandas

2. Use PostgreSQL as database

3. Flask/Python

4. HTML, CSS, and Javascript

5. D3, Plotly, Chart.js and Leaflet to visualize

6. Use SciKit-Learn to make predictions
